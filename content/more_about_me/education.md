    description: "Through a fellowship with [Coding It Forward](https://www.codingitforward.com/), I worked as a data science intern with the US Special Operations Command. I assisted in the creation of a machine learning model for predictive maintenance on CV-22 helicopters to reduce downtime & improve readiness. 
    
    
    I also built a fullstack web application from scratch that automates the process of verifying inventory data. The tool is expected to save roughly 2,500 man hours and $102,000 annually.
