summary: ""

abstract: This case study describes an exploratory research project undertaken in a short period of time using online survey methodology. The project aimed to understand the attitudes and potential actions of European Union migrants living in the United Kingdom in the months before the 2016 British referendum on European Union membership. The case describes in detail the context of the project, the reasons for the chosen research design, and practicalities involved in designing the questionnaire, recruiting participants on online platforms such as Facebook, and the use of survey administration software.
