abstract: This paper examines Hungarian migration to the United Kingdom
  following EU accession. Migration from Hungary has generally been low both
  before and after accession, but trends have recently started to change. Based
  on the available statistical data, the paper explores the volume, key
  demographics and geographical distribution of this migration, and shows how a
  combination of economic, political and social factors is accountable for the
  migration of Hungarians to the United Kingdom. To give a human face to the
  phenomenon, the paper also builds on narrative interviews collected during
  recent ethnographic fieldwork in London, highlighting the role of economic
  decline, policy miscalculations, language competence and the online migration
  industry in shaping the motivations, aims and accommodation of migrants. The
  paper suggests that migration from Hungary may become more dominant in the
  second decade of the countryâ€™s EU membership than it has been during the first
  ten years.
