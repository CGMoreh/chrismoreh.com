summary: ""

abstract: "This paper examines Hungarian migration to the United Kingdom following EU
accession. Migration from Hungary has generally been low both before and after
accession, but trends have recently started to change. Based on the available statistical data, the first part of the paper explores the volume, key demographics and geographical distribution of this migration. The author estimates the current number of first generation Hungarian migrants in the United Kingdom to be at around 86,000, more
than one third of whom reside in London. Hungarian migrants are also shown to be young, balanced in terms of gender, and mobile – with more than half of the migrants registering for National Insurance Numbers re-migrating in less than two years.
To give a human face to the phenomenon, the second part of the paper analyses narrative interviews collected during a 2013 ethnographic fieldwork in London, highlighting the role of economic decline, policy miscalculations, language competence and the online migration industry in shaping the motivations, aims and accommodation of migrants. The data analysed in the paper also suggests that migration from Hungary is likely to intensify in the years to come, and that the freedoms and rights conferred by EU membership are allowing a highly complex configuration of migration patterns and
modalities, urging a reconsideration of the dialectic between temporality and settlement."
