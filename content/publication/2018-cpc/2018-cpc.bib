	abstract = {Concerns about EU migrants’ use of public healthcare services in the UK are widespread. The
assumption is that high quality free universal healthcare provision in the UK attracts migrants and
allows potential abuse of the system. This research examines migrants’ perceptions and preferences
around healthcare, and our findings suggest that these assumptions are often unfounded, with
migrants’ preferring to have medical treatment in their country of origin, where they often perceive
the standard of healthcare to be higher than that of the UK.},
