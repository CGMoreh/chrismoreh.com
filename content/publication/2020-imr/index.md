abstract: Intra-EU migrants have traditionally faced few pressures or incentives
  to formalize their “permanent” residence or to naturalize in their EU host
  countries. Focusing on the United Kingdom and combining an analysis of
  secondary administrative data and primary online survey data (N = 1,413), this
  article examines practices and attitudes toward such legal integration in the
  context of the 2016 EU Referendum among five major EU nationality groups. The
  analysis reveals that British citizenship is the main legal mechanism of
  integration among intra-EU migrants in the United Kingdom and that while there
  is continuity in this respect with pre-Brexit processes, Brexit also has a
  strong but differential effect as a driver of legal integration. The article
  identifies some of the main decision-influencing factors shaping legal
  integration, making a significant contribution to understanding the
  complexities of integrative processes in times of radical structural change.
