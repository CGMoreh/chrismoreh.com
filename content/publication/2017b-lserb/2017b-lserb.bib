	abstract = {In Why the UK Voted for Brexit: David Cameron’s Great Miscalculation, Andrew Glencross offers an analysis of ‘Brexit’: the UK referendum vote on 23 June 2016 to leave the European Union. While the pace of developments since the book’s publication make some of its observations inevitably prematurely obsolete, this remains an important and historically sensitive account of this momentous event in the domestic and international political landscape, writes Chris Moreh.},
