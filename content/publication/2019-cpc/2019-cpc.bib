	abstract = {EU migrants have, so far, been most affected by the Brexit process. Polish nationals are the largest single EU nationality group in the UK, and their ongoing experiences and expectations will shape their social attitudes post-Brexit. These attitudes can signal the emergence of new social divisions.
New data collected by us in an online survey suggests that Poles are most worried about their future financial situation. These fears are expressed in two distinct ways: one showing migrants and their concerns as separate from the British population; and one showing that their concerns are the same as British citizensâ€™, highlighting a sense of shared community.
Our findings identify some policy measures to strengthen social cohesion by reinforcing a sense of community, rather than division.},
