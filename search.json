By categorising engagements with healthcare\n    providers based on their occurrence in time it argues for an\n    understanding of transnational healthcare as a process.

This complexity is also reflected in the\n    multiple ways in which access to services with regards to specific\n    health issues unfolds in time. By focusing the analysis on specific\n    health issues rather than individuals the article finds that\n    multiple ways to access healthcare services coexist for the same\n    participant, who does not necessarily move towards particular\n    healthcare providers unitarily, but adopts ad hoc solutions on the\n    basis of their experiences within specific medical areas.\n    Understanding migrants’ patterns of accessing healthcare can\n    contribute to more effective policy solutions supporting migrants in\n    the UK today.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nTroccoli, Giuseppe, Chris Moreh, Derek McGhee, and Athina Vlachantoni.\n2022. “Transnational Healthcare as Process: Multiplicity and\nDirectionality in the Engagements with Healthcare Among Polish Migrants\nin the UK.” Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies 48\n(9): 1998–2017. https://doi.org/10.1080/1369183X.2021.1941820."

It\n    combines discourse-analytic conceptual tools and ethno- graphic\n    methods to explore discursive practices at the macro-level of\n    governmental policy, the meso–level of institutional policies of\n    nine UK hoshuko , and the micro-level of situated practices at one\n    UK school. We demonstrate how governmental discourses pursue\n    specific coercive aims using discursive strategies, and how these\n    are recontextualised in institutional and individual practices. At\n    each level, we also identify mechanisms through which the official\n    dominant discourse is negotiated. Based on the findings, we ar- gue\n    that a more purposeful policy realignment acknowledging local\n    diversity would benefit the overseas communities involved in\n    hoshuko.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nDanjo, Chisato, and Chris Moreh. 2020. “Complementary Schools in\nthe Global Age: A Multi-Level Critical Analysis of Discourses and\nPractices at Japanese Hoshuko in the UK.” Linguistics and\nEducation 60 (100870): 1–12. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.linged.2020.100870."

Centring its discussion on a theorisation of “heritage”,\n    the article introduces the concept of “heritagification” as a useful\n    way of understanding the local historical-political dimensions of\n    urban conflict in populated World Heritage Sites, defining it as the\n    localised material and empirical manifestation of a universal\n    ideological principle. In the Albayzín, the article argues, the main\n    struggle develops around providing the neighbourhood with a future\n    meaning, function and inhabitants. Competing perspectives are\n    heavily influenced by visions of the past, the main divide\n    stretching between Muslim and Christian interpretations of the\n    neighbourhood’s historic heritage. The article describes, using\n    qualitative data, how heritagification ascribes its own logic and\n    value system to processes of urban change, promoting a version of\n    historical truth that is best able to capitalise on the urban\n    heritage of the neighbourhood.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMoreh, Chris. 2016. “Inhabiting Heritage: Living with the Past in\nthe Albayzín of Granada.” Open Library of Humanities 2\n(1): 1–33. https://doi.org/10.16995/olh.24."

    "text": "What is a simplex?\nA simplex is the generalization of a triangle to \\(n\\) dimensions. In this blog post, we are exclusively interested in 2-simplices, that is: triangles.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Examples of some \\(n\\)-simplices: point, line, triangle, and tetrahedron.\n\n\nThe mathematical formulation for everything within a (\\(J-1\\)) simplex \\(\\Delta\\) is pretty uncanny:\n\\[\n            \\Delta =\n            \\left\\{\n                x\\in\\mathbb{R}^J: x = \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^J\\pi_j v_j\n                \\quad\n                \\text{with}\n                \\quad\n                0\\leq \\pi_j \\leq 1, \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^J\\pi_j=1\n            \\right\\}.\n\\]\nThis sounds overly complex, but it basically just says “a vector of numbers that is non-negative, sums to one, and lies within the vertices”.\nBut why would we care about simplices? It turns out that some interesting data types actually live in simplices (plural of simplex). One example are compartmental data: By volume, the dry air in Earth’s atmosphere is about 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, and 1 percent argon (source). These percentages sum to one and can be visualized in a simplex. The main reason for me to develop the {ggsimplex}` page are so-called posterior model probabilities.\nSay we compare \\(J\\) different candidate models \\(M_1, \\ldots, M_J\\) in a Bayesian setting and we want to assess their fit to a data set \\(y\\). Then, we can use Bayes’ formula (through some intricate computational methods) to estimate the probability of each model given the observed data, namely the posterior model probability (PMP) for each model \\(M_j\\): \\(p(M_j\\,|\\,y)\\). By definition, the PMPs sum to one: \\(\\sum_{j=1}^J p(M_j\\,|\\, y)=1\\). So PMPs on a fixed data set are data that live within a simplex 🤩"

By reflecting on your successes and failures, you can work more efficiently and improve your research processes.\nTo perform a retrospective, the team should set aside a specific time to reflect on the completed project or a particular phase of the project. Each team member should be encouraged to share their thoughts, feelings, and feedback openly and honestly. The team should discuss what worked well, what didn’t work, and what could be improved. Retrospectives should be conducted regularly, preferably after each iteration, to continuously improve the workflow and achieve better results.\nAs a junior researcher, you may not have the opportunity to issue a retrospective with all members of a project. However, you can still have a solo retrospective on your tasks. You can ask yourself questions like “What worked well and should be repeated next time?” or “What didn’t work out well and should be changed right away?” or “What are the next steps, and when are they due?”"

    "title": "Queen Rania at AUC",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This morning AUC’s John D. Gerhart Center for Civic Engagement hosted a lecture by Queen Rania al-Abdullah of Jordan. Queen Rania is famous for being intensely involved in the public sphere and, according to the venerable Wikipedia, is considered one of the world’s most powerful women. She’s involved with a ton of foundations and NGOs that cover a wide range of goals, from advocating for improvement in girls’ education and employment, promoting dialogue between the US and the Arab world, and calling for what became the buzzword of today’s lecture: civic engagement. She uses technology to promote her agenda of social improvement and is active on YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook. Basically a beautiful, famous, powerful world leader.\nQueen Rania focused primarily on the need for native grassroots movements in the Arab world, stating that civic engagement is an essential element of societal reform—changes so desperately needed in this region, where poverty and corruption are rampant. She stated that it is the responsibility of all citizens to take an interest in developing and improving their own country. Calling on Arabs to “look up” and think of others, she cited the example of one of AUC’s homegrown NGOs, Alashanek Ya Balady, which is heavily involved in promoting sustainable development in Egypt’s poorest neighborhoods. The efforts of AYB and dozens of other organizations constitute a laudable homegrown effort to reform Egyptian society, and they have had lots of success so far.\nThe queen then went on to decry the current state of civic laziness in the Arab world, saying that many Arabs confuse the responsibilities of “citizenship” with “sitizenship,” opting to sit still, sit back, and complain rather than take their own initiative to change society. This is not because Arabs are disconnected, emotionless people—far from it. “We’re all passionate about food, family, football, and Filistin,” she said, but those passions need to be refocused on bringing about change instead of complacently complaining about the backwardness of Arab governments and societies.\nShe developed this theme by responding to a series of preselected questions that followed her main motivational speech, declaring that universities and academia are responsible for remaining engaged with society and not remain isolated in academia. Too often the educated class remains cynically aloof from the rest of the world and fails to contribute real change or instill the culture of civic engagement in their pupils. She also noted the role of Islam in developing this culture of engagement, saying that Islam inherently advocates civic reform and grassroots movements. She called on the audience to “recapture those compassionate values of Islam” that have been hijacked by Western media and use the power of faith to help improve society.\nEssentially, she concluded, if we want to see any reform and improvement in the region, the onus is on citizens. Change in the Middle East cannot come from governments, since they are inherently inefficient. Real change can only come about with a change in attitude and an increase in engagement. Regular citizens are the driving factor for this change.\nIn the end it was a pretty motivating and inspiring speech, and I agree with most of what she said. Real, lasting change in the Middle East will need to come from some type of bottom-up popular movement, especially when the reforms so desperately needed reduce the power of the ruling class. However, repressive governments throughout the Arab world (including Rania’s Jordan) severely limit what progressive movements can do, and Middle Eastern dictatorships last for decades.\nFor example, Egypt’s current president, Hosni Mubarak, has been in power for almost 30 years. He ran the country uncontestedly until 2005, when, after pressure from George W. Bush, Mubarak amended the constitution to allow candidates from parties other than the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) to run in presidential elections. The first “free and fair” elections were held that year. Despite a somewhat large grassroots political opposition movement, Kifaya, Mubarak won handily and his opponent, Ayman Nour, was arrested and sentenced to prison for five years. Today Kifaya, a native grassroots movement, is detoothed and powerless. Good thing civic engagement worked…\nThe next Egyptian presidential elections are slated for 2011, but since Mubarak is getting on in years (he’s 81!), he’s probably not going to run. Instead, it seems that his son, Gamal Mubarak, will inherit his father’s place. Sure, he’ll go through the farce of the election process, but the NDP politicos and thugs will pretty much guarantee his victory.\nUnderstandably, there is a growing anti-Gamal movement in Egypt, and it’s even homegrown and grassrooty. It got a huge boost last week when Mohamed ElBaradei, former head of the IAEA and winner of a Nobel Prize, returned to Cairo after a decades-long pseudo-exile. He has announced that he would consider running for president in 2011 if circumstances allowed for it. He already has a large base of support and even an official-ish campaign website. American media is picking up on him, too. He has a lot of international clout and could present a real threat to the Mubarak dynasty. He might have the potential of becoming the Egyptian Obama—“Yes we can!”\nBut (and this is a pretty big but…), he can’t even legally run—he’s not constitutionally permitted to run for president. For him to become president, Mubarak would first have to amend the constitution to open the field for more opposition parities. Then ElBaradei would actually have to win in elections run by the NDP. Yeah. Good luck there.\nWhile the possibility of an ElBaradei run has Mubarak somewhat scared, the cards are really stacked against him. This growing popular movement faces the impossible task of forcing a constitutional amendment. It’s a native movement, just like Queen Rania wants, but it is severely limited. Egyptians remain hopeful, but sadly, Gamal will most likely take over in 2011.\nWhile Jordan, as a monarchy, doesn’t face these issues of presidential elections, it has its own slew of problems with citizenship. Although Rania herself is a Palestinian, the Jordanian government regularly withdraws Jordanian nationality and rights from Palestinian refugees. How can native, grassroots Jordanian organizations reform when the government makes them stateless?\nIn her speech Rania exhorted AUCians: “Don’t wait for governments to change and reform. You must be the change you want to see.” Um. She’s in the Jordanian government. She’s the queen! She surely has some influence on the Jordanian political scene. Can’t she help the government change so that these popular groups can actually do something? Arab governments tolerate, even embrace, NGOs like AYB or the queen’s water projects in Jordan—they love this type of civic engagement. But heaven forbid these civically engaged movements threaten their despotic power, though.\nCan real governmental and societal change happen in the Middle East solely through “civic engagement.” No way. Arab governments must make changes if any popular movements want to make substantial change.\nSo, while Queen Rania’s speech was inspiring and motivational on the surface, it was full of kalaam fadi—empty words.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "Functional Programming in R, Part 1: Basics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What is functional programming?\nReady for a quick dive into the wonderful world of functional programming? Whether you’re a seasoned programmer or just starting your journey with R for some data science project, getting a grasp on functional programming will not only add a new weapon to your data science arsenal but also make your code more efficient and readable. So, without further ado, let’s get started!\nFunctional programming, put simply, is a programming style that mimics mathematical functions. You might be thinking, “Isn’t all programming based on functions?” Well, yes, but functional programming takes this concept to the next level. It’s all about structuring your code as a series of reusable, interconnected functions, each doing one specific task and doing it well. In this blog post, we’ll focus on functions as arguments to other functions.\nNow, why should you, an R programmer, care about this? Well, R might not be a pure functional programming language, but it does offer strong functional programming capabilities. Mastering them can make your code more effective and attractive. Plus, functional programming principles can help us eliminate redundant code and make our scripts more maintainable.\nIt’s a bit like building with Lego blocks. Each block (or function) has its own shape and purpose, and you can connect them in various ways to create whatever you want. And the best part? You can disassemble and reassemble them without affecting the individual blocks!\nBasics in R: Passing functions as arguments\nLet’s start with a powerful feature that many data science workflows heavily benefit from: passing functions as arguments to other functions. This concept might seem a bit tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, you’ll see how it adds a whole new level of flexibility and efficiency to your code.\nIn R, functions are “first-class citizens”, meaning they can be treated just like any other object or data type. They can be assigned to variables, stored in lists, and most importantly for our current discussion, passed as arguments to other functions. This feature allows us to create more general, reusable functions and reduce code repetition.\nExample 1: Using the apply() function\nOne of the most common examples of passing a function as an argument is using the apply() function in R. The apply() applies a function to the rows or columns of a matrix or data frame. Here’s how it works.\nWe will first set the stage and initialize a \\(2 \\times 3\\) matrix m:\n\n# Create a matrix\nm = matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2)\n\nprint(m)\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    3    5\n[2,]    2    4    6\n\n\nNow, suppose we want to calculate the sum of each row in m. We could do that manually via:\n\n# Initialize a vector to store the row sums\nrow_sums = numeric(nrow(m))\n\nfor (i in seq_len(nrow(m))){\n  row_sums[i] = sum(m[i, ])\n}\n\nprint(row_sums)\n\n[1]  9 12\n\n\nBut this code is pretty clunky for such a simple task and, more importantly, hard to maintain. What if we wanted to compute the sum of each column? We would need to\n\nrename row_sums to col_nums both at the initialization and within the for loop;\ncarefully adjust the iterator i so that it iterates over [1, ..., ncol(m)]; and finally\nadjust the matrix slicing to m[, i].\n\nI don’t know about you, but I would probably miss at least one of those adjustments.\n\n\nExample: Using the apply function to calculate row sums.\n\nSo let’s rewrite row_sums as a one-liner via functional programming. We use the function apply(X, MARGIN, FUN), which works as follows:\n\n\nX: The object that we operate on. In our case, we want to apply some function on parts of the matrix m, so X = m.\n\nMARGIN: You can select whether you want to apply the function to each row (MARGIN = 1), to each column (MARGIN=2), or to rows and columns combined (MARGIN=c(1,2)). We want to compute the sum of each row, so we choose MARGIN = 1.\n\nFUN: The actual function that you want to apply across the rows or columns. In our case, it’s the sum function.\n\n\n# Apply the sum function to the rows of the matrix\nrow_sums = apply(m, MARGIN=1, FUN=sum)\n\nprint(row_sums)\n\n[1]  9 12\n\n\nIf you want to take your first steps towards functional programming, go ahead and try those two exercises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\nChange the example code so that it calculates the column sums of the matrix m instead of the row sums. The answer should be [3, 7, 11].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\nChange the example code so that calculates the mean of each column in m instead of the sum. The answer should be [1.5, 3.5, 5.5].\n\n\nExample 2: Additional arguments to FUN – ignore missing values\nSuppose we have a matrix of data, and some of the values are missing, as represented by NA:\n\n# Create a matrix\nm = matrix(c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2)\n\nprint(m)\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1   NA    5\n[2,]    2    4    6\n\n\nIf we simply execute the code from the previous example, we will get NA in the row with a missing value:\n\n# Compute row sums (without handling NA)\nrow_sums = apply(m, MARGIN=1, FUN=sum)\nprint(row_sums)\n\n[1] NA 12\n\n\nIf we think about it, it’s not surprising: Behind the scenes, we execute sum(c(1, NA, 5)) and that’s NA. If you are a bit into data science with R, you might know that sum(c(1, NA, 5), na.rm=TRUE) would ignore the NA value and return the sum of the non-NA values, which is 6. So we need a way to funnel na.rm through the apply function into sum. Lucky for us, there is a straightforward way. We can simply add any additional arguments in our call to apply as follows:\n\n# Compute the sum of each row, removing NA values\nrow_sums &lt;- apply(m, 1, sum, na.rm=TRUE)\n\nprint(row_sums)\n\n[1]  6 12\n\n\nIn this example, we’re passing the sum function as an argument to the apply function as usual. But we’re also passing na.rm=TRUE as an additional argument to the sum function. This means that when apply calls the sum function for each row, it’s actually calling sum(row, na.rm=TRUE). Perfect!\nExample 3: Custom functions – computing error metrics\nSuppose you are writing some machine learning algorithm that aims to predict the true value for four test cases. But your algorithm tries to quantify some notion of uncertainty around that prediction. Therefore, it outputs three values for each case:\n\n# Define a true vector and a predicted matrix\ntrue &lt;- c(1, 3, 2, 2)\npredicted &lt;- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2), nrow = 4)\n\nfor (i in seq_along(true)){\n  cat(\"True:\", true[i], \"| predictions:\", predicted[i, ], \"\\n\")\n}\n\nTrue: 1 | predictions: 1 3 3 \nTrue: 3 | predictions: 2 4 2 \nTrue: 2 | predictions: 3 1 2 \nTrue: 2 | predictions: 2 3 2 \n\n\nNow, you want to quantify the error for each case with some metric to know how good the set of predictions is for each case. In this example, we’ll first use the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as our metric. MSE is a common metric for regression problems, measuring the average squared differences between the true and predicted values. Here, it will quantify the error between the set of predictions \\(\\hat{y}_1, \\ldots, \\hat{y}_N\\) and the true value \\(y^*\\) for a single case, \\(MSE=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N(y^*-\\hat{y}_i)^2\\).\n\n# Define a function to compute the Mean Squared Error\nmse &lt;- function(true, predicted) {\n  return (mean((true - predicted) ** 2))\n}\n\nIf we want to know how well the algorithm predicts the first test case, we can simply call:\n\nmse(true[1], predicted[1, ])\n\n[1] 2.666667\n\n\nThis is the prediction error for the first case, and we could compute such an error for every case in the test set. Now, let’s create a function that takes the entire true vector, the entire predicted matrix, and an error metric function as arguments. It will apply the error metric function to the true vector and each column of the predicted matrix. It might seem like a bit of an overkill for now, but it will be worth it very soon:\n\n# Create a function that computes the error between a true vector and each column of a predicted matrix\ncompute_errors &lt;- function(true, predicted, error_func) {\n  # Initialize a vector to store the errors\n  errors &lt;- numeric(ncol(predicted))\n  \n  # For each column in the predicted matrix\n  for (i in seq_len(ncol(predicted))) {\n    # Compute the error between the true vector and the current column\n    errors[i] &lt;- error_func(true, predicted[,i])\n  }\n  \n  return(errors)\n}\n\nFinally, let’s use our compute_error function to compute the MSE between the true vector and each column of the prediction matrix:\n\n# Use the custom function to compute the MSEs\nerrors &lt;- compute_errors(true, predicted, error_func=mse)\n\nprint(errors)\n\n[1] 0.50 1.75 1.25\n\n\nIn this example, we compute the MSE between the true vector and each column of the predicted matrix. We achieve this by passing the mse function as an argument to the compute_errors function. This demonstrates how passing functions as arguments can make your code more flexible and modular, enabling you to easily switch between different error metrics. It was a bit of upfront work, but it reduces the actual call to compute the errors down to a single line of code.\nBut this functional programming paradigm really shines when we want to replace the error function that we apply! Let’s compute the Mean Average Error (MAE) instead of the MSE. No problem with our functional programming solution. After all, the concrete error function just an argument to our compute_errors wrapper that implements all the logic. We just define the mae function \\(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N | y^*-\\hat{y}_i|\\) and plug it into the compute_errors wrapper:\n\n# Define a function to compute the Mean Absolute Error\nmae &lt;- function(true, predicted) {\n  return (mean(abs(true - predicted)))\n}\n\n# Use the custom function to compute the MAEs\nerrors &lt;- compute_errors(true, predicted, error_func=mae)\n\nprint(errors)\n\n[1] 0.50 1.25 0.75\n\n\nBoom, we compute the MAE between each case from the true vector and each corresponding set of predictions from the predicted matrix. All we had to do is pass the mae function as an argument to the compute_errors function. Most importantly, we did not need to make any changes to the compute_errors function – instead, we just provided a drop-in replacement for the error_func that compute_errors applies internally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\n\n\nAdjust the MAE example code so that NA values are ignored and the mean is computed with respect to all non-NA values.\n\n\nNext up: partial functions with {purrr}\n\nFor me personally, one of the most fascinating aspects of functional programming in R is the concept of ‘partial functions’. This concept allows us to create new functions from existing ones by pre-filling some of the arguments. Think of it as a customizable tool that you can tweak to fit your specific needs.\nIn part 2 of this blog post series, we’ll be taking a closer look at partial functions in R. We’ll understand how they work, why they’re useful, and how you can use them to make your R code even more efficient, elegant, and re-usable.\n\n\n Back to top"

This\n    article explores the role of junctures within healthcare systems in\n    the connections migrants realize between healthcare systems and\n    sectors. The article argues that in a transnational context,\n    migrants enact these junctures by joining different levels of care\n    within the same sector, between sectors and across national borders.\n    In particular, the article explores how Polish migrants’ healthcare\n    seeking practices within and beyond national borders are enacted\n    given the features, availability and relationship between primary\n    and specialist care for how they are articulated between private and\n    public sectors. Methods: This article is based on the second phase\n    of a mixed-methods study on how Polish people in the UK manage their\n    health transnationally. The participants were purposefully sampled\n    from survey respondents (first phase) who identified as having a\n    long-term health condition or caring in a non-professional capacity\n    for someone who is chronically ill. Thirty-two semi-structured\n    audio-call interviews were conducted with Polish migrants living in\n    England between June and August 2020. Transcripts were analysed by\n    applying thematic coding. Results: Key findings include a mix of\n    dissatisfaction and satisfaction with primary care and general\n    satisfaction with specialist care. Coping strategies consisting in\n    reaching specialist private healthcare provided a way to access\n    specialist care at all or additionally, or to partially complement\n    primary care. When Polish private specialists are preferred, this is\n    due to participants’ availability of time and financial resources,\n    and to the specialists’ capacity to fulfil needs unmet within the\n    public healthcare sector in the UK. Conclusion: Polish migrants join\n    with their practices systems which are not integrated, and their\n    access is limited by the constraints implied in accessing paid\n    services in Poland. This shapes transnational healthcare practices\n    as relating mostly to routine and ad-hoc access to healthcare. These\n    practices impact not only the wellbeing of migrants and the\n    development of the private market but also the public health\n    provision of services.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nTroccoli, Giuseppe, Chris Moreh, Derek McGhee, and Athina Vlachantoni.\n2022. “At the Junctures of Healthcare: A Qualitative Study of\nPrimary and Specialist Service Use by Polish Migrants in\nEngland.” BMC Health Services Research 22 (1316): 1–12.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08666-z."

    "title": "Handbook on Brexit and Migration",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nMigration has played a crucial role in the United Kingdom’s decision to exit the EU, and Brexit has significantly impacted the whole nation, particularly the lives of EU nationals and their families living in the UK as well as British nationals residing in the other 27 EU countries. A significant body of social scientific literature has documented these processes since 2016. However, “Brexit”, far from representing solely a unique and historically specific event, raises various and more general questions about how states, political establishments, the EU, citizens and migrants navigate the challenges posed by radical socio-political transformations and “unsettling” events. It also highlights the changing relations between citizenship, identity and the sense of belonging. Analysing migration processes - past, present and future - through this broader analytical lens can tell us about the emerging social cleavages and tensions that will likely dominate the first half of the 21st century. This handbook proposes to pull together these various aspects to provide an authoritative interdisciplinary research-driven statement on the Brexit-migration nexus both as a historically conjunctural sociological experience and as a conceptual tool for framing changes in mobility patterns, policy and legal structures, and European politics.\nThe overall approach of the handbook - as reflected in its structure - is to take the reader on a journey, starting from the question of whether and how migration affected the UK’s decision to leave the European Union, through exploring the migration trends and policy frameworks shaped by the Brexit event, the social reactions to the yet unsettled changes engendered by the Brexit process, and finally the complex ways in which migrants of various backgrounds are affected by radical socio-political restructuring.\n\n\nProposed structure and contributors\nThe handbook aims to bring together a large variety of approaches and case-studies discussed in the emerging literature on migration in the context of Brexit. With this aim, it will seek shorter contributions from a large number of authoritative voices - both from established academics and young scholars - that are able to make a central analytical point based on original empirical research. It will comprise around 40 chapters of 5,000 words in length, adding up to approximately 200,000 words ( ~ 400 pages including references). The chapters of the handbook are organised in six parts, following an introduction by the editors. The introduction will be a full-length contribution outlining the main concepts and problems addressed in the book. Part 1 focuses on the central political event of the UK’s 2016 EU membership referendum, placing it in the broader ideological and political context of Euroscepticism dating back to the establishment of the European Union in the early 1990s and the changing demographics of migration to the UK over the following two decades. Through a selection of authoritative research-driven analyses, it aims to provide answers to the following contentious questions: in what sense can migration be held accountable for the vote for Brexit? How did Eurosceptic political actors manage to mobilise the “superdiversification” of migration to elicit a popular revolt against the perceived political elite driven by wider dissatisfaction with economic disenfranchisement following the global financial crisis of 2008, among both the “majority” and the “ethnic minority” British population? And what role did mass media - and the changing media landscape - play in these processes?\nPart 2 moves away from the immediate context of the EU referendum to provide a quantitative and legal-conceptual overview of the UK’s migration system in its relationship to Brexit. The chapters in this section will discuss in detail the main types of mobility which have figured prominently in public discourses and migration statistics and will discuss how these mobilities have changed and developed in post-Brexit UK\nParts 3 and 4 explore the various reactions given by non-citizens to the radical socio-political transformation posed by the Brexit process. Part 3 focuses on what in a Hirschmannian tradition could be called “voice” and “exit” reactions; on the one hand, Brexit has given rise to a new consciousness around the value and vulnerability of supranational rights and forms of belonging, leading to new forms of grass-roots political activism that provide empirical anchors for studying the formation of social movements; on the other hand, Brexit may have been a factor in decisions to return to the country of origin or move to a third country, and this part of the volume makes an empirically informed intervention in the study of return migration. Part 4 completes the Hirschmannian-inspired triptych with a focus on the strategies of those EU nationals who chose to remain in the UK following its rupture from the EU community of rights. The chapters in this part challenge the classical literature on migrant integration and assimilation through citizenship by emphasising the diversity and subtlety of practices and narrations of belonging. By reflecting on more durable emerging attitudinal patterns, on the ways in which the Brexit event was embedded into migrants’ life-courses, and on the views and lives of young people of EU migrant backgrounds, for whom Brexit forms an integral part in their socialisation and coming of age, these chapters discuss the Brexit-migration nexus as an important mechanism reshaping Britain’s social structure.\nPart 5 collects a number of case studies discussing the diversity of legal statuses, migration histories and regional identities, aiming to break down views of a monolithic EU citizenship experience both before and after Brexit. As such, Part 5 will critically engage with the issue of complex borders and boundary making as a result of the post-Brexit migration regime.\nFinally, Part 6 explores the legal frameworks and political-economic dynamics shaping the future of British nationals living in EU countries, as well as narrowing down on the experiences of Britons in a few selected EU countries.\n\n\nTentative Table of Contents\n\nIntroduction: definitions, concepts, problems\n\nPART 1: Migration and Brexit: a troubled relationship\n\nPolitical Euroscepticism, immigration and the long road to Brexit\nThe politics of Brexit in the context of migration\nMedia discourses on immigration in the Brexit debate\nEU enlargement (Turkey) and the Brexit debate\nCEE migration and the Brexit debate\nEthnic minorities, Euroscepticism and Brexit\n\nPART 2: Migration governance and Brexit: trends, legal frameworks and forecasts\n\nTransformations of the British migration system\nProbabilistic forecasts of migration post-Brexit\nThe European and British asylum systems before and after Brexit\nPoints-based immigration\nResidence rights and wrongs: settled status, unsettled lives?\nHigher education governance and student migration after Brexit\n\nPART 3: Voice and exit\n\nEU nationals’ political engagement/activism\nEthnic minorities and pro-EU grassroots activism\nMigration trends in the post-referendum interstitial period\nReturn migrants\nSkilled return migrants\nStudent migration/return intentions\n\nPART 4: Citizenship, belonging and embeddedness\n\nLegal integration and beyond\nWhat does Brexit tell us about citizenship?\nRacial geographies and histories of citizenship\nA new politics of belonging?\nLongitudinal life-course perspectives of EU migrants in the UK\nYoung people with EU migrant backgrounds\n\nPART 5: New and Old Hierarchies of privilege and belonging\nHierarchies of EU citizenship\n\nMigrant experiences before Brexit\nMigrant experiences post-Brexit\nEmotional costs of integration and hierarchies of privilege\nHighly skilled migrant experiences\n\nRegional identities and experiences\n\nEU nationals in Wales\nScottishness, Brexit and migration\nNorthern Ireland\n\nComplex statuses and identities\n\nEuropean naturalised third-country nationals in the UK\nLatin American onward migrants\nRace and coloniality\nEuropean naturalised third-country nationals in the UK\n\nPART 6: UK nationals in the EU\n\nBritish citizens living in the EU: a legal assessment\nBritish citizens living in the EU: a sociological overview\nBritons in Belgium\nBritons in Germany\nBritons in Germany\nBritons in France\nBritons in Spain\n\nConclusions\n\nThe state of the art and future directions in research on Brexit and migration\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
